# tic-tac-toe-ai
A Tabular Q-Learning AI to play the classic game, Tic-Tac-Toe.

To use and play with the AI, run the Tic Tac Toe Client GUI, found in src/tictactoe/TicTacToeGUI.java. The Tabular Q-Learning model will train for a few moments, and when complete, a 3x3 grid will appear where you can click to place your marking for the game. The AI will automatically respond.

All the code used was authored by Raul Hernandez in 2023 using Eclipse IDE.
